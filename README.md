# Spring Security - Argon2 Password Encoder

This is a spring security password encoder that uses the Argon2 algorithm for hashing. This supports all three Argon2 variants.

## Argon2 Implementation

This particular password encoder does not come with its own Argon2 bindings. Instead, this uses 
[Moritz Kammerer's Argon2 library](https://github.com/phxql/argon2-jvm).

His library binds against the native Argon2 binaries. However, they have only been compiled for x86 and x86_64 based 
systems. What this means is that ARM/Power systems are not supported out of the box.

## What is Argon2?

[Argon2](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2) is a hashing algorithm with three major variants—Argon2i, Argon2d, 
and Argon2id.

Argon2i provides higher levels of safety against side-channel attacks than Argon2d while Argon2d provides higher levels 
of safety against GPU-based cracking.

Argon2id is a bit of a hybrid between both other variants. This variant provides some of the resistance from Argon2 and 
a lot of the resistance from Argon2d.

In theory, Argon2 should provide better security than other existing algorithms—including bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2, 
shaXXX, etc.
